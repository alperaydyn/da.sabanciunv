In this course, we will cover fundamental aspects of Machine Learning. We will start with fundamentals of machine learning, including different learning paradigms, regression and classification problems, evaluation methods, generalization and overfitting. We will then cover some of the fundamental machine learning techniques such as decision trees, Bayesian approaches, Naive Bayes classifier, and logistic regression, k-Nearest neighbor, and online learning algorithms. Besides understanding the basic theory behind the techniques, students are expected to apply them on different platforms like Weka or Matlab.
