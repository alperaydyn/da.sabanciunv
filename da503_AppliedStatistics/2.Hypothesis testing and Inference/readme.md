### Inferential Statistics
Inferential statistics use a random sample of data taken from a population to describe and make inferences about the population.[*](https://support.minitab.com/en-us/minitab-express/1/help-and-how-to/basic-statistics/inference/supporting-topics/basics/what-are-inferential-statistics/)
### Validity and reliability
If one person takes the same personality test several times and always receives the same results, the test isreliable.

A test is valid if it measures what it is supposed to measure. If the results of the personality test claimed that a very shy person was in fact outgoing, the test would be invalid.

Suppose your bathroomscale was reset to read 10 pound lighter. The weight it reads will be reliable(the same every time you step on it) but will not be valid, since it is notreading your actual weight.
