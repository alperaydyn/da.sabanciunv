# Refresher and Warm-up (0.5 week)
## Random variable
Is a variable with numeric possible values, has types Discrete and Continious
* Discrete Random Variable :  finite number of distinct values
* Continious Random Variable : infinite nunmber of possible values

## Distribution function
The probability distribution of a discrete random variable is a list of probabilities associated with each of its possible values. It is also sometimes called the probability function or the probability mass function.

A random number generator acting over an interval of numbers (a,b) has a continuous distribution. 

## Properties of data
* mean:
* median:
* geometrik mean:
* standart deviation: 
* skewness: measured of lack of symemtri, close to zero means symmetric. positive means right tailed, negative means left tailed. s<0.5 means symmetric, 0.5<s<1 means skewed, s>1 is very skewed.
* kurtuosis: measures the similarity of a perfect bell shaped distribution. Positive kurtuosis means pointy, negative kurtuosis means flat distribution compared to the perfect bell curve. If the peak of the curve is sharp then it is highly kurtuosis

## Levels of measurement
* nominal
* ordinal
* interval
* ratio
