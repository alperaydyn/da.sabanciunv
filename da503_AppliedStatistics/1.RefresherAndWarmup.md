# Refresher and Warm-up (0.5 week)
## Random variable
Is a variable with numeric possible values, has types Discrete and Continious
* Discrete Random Variable :  finite number of distinct values
* Continious Random Variable : infinite nunmber of possible values

## Distribution function
The probability distribution of a discrete random variable is a list of probabilities associated with each of its possible values. It is also sometimes called the probability function or the probability mass function.

A random number generator acting over an interval of numbers (a,b) has a continuous distribution. 

## Properties of data
* mean:
* median:
* geometrik mean:
* standart deviation: 
* skewness: measured of lack of symemtri, close to zero means symmetric. positive means right tailed, negative means left tailed.
* kurtuosis: measures the similarity of a perfect bell shaped distribution. Positive kurtuosis means pointy, negative kurtuosis means flat distribution compared to the perfect bell curve.
