In the scope of this course we will begin with data extraction, cleaning, and normalization to prepare the data for Data Mining Algorithms. We will then cover Data Mining techniques including association rule mining, sequential patterns, clustering, text mining. Students are expected to understand the fundamental theory behind each technique, as well as implementing them using an environment such as RapidMiner or Weka.
